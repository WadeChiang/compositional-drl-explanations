We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

Answer:
<start>

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

Answer:
<start>

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

Answer:
<start>

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

Answer:
<start>

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

Answer:
<start>

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

Answer:
<start>

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Global Strategy:

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

1. Check Vertical Velocity (V_y) and Altitude (Y Coord):
   - Near Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is upward or low and the lander is near the ground, do nothing.
   - Far from Ground:
     - If vertical velocity (V_y) is low and the lander is far from the ground, and the angle is near 0, do nothing.

2. Monitor Angular Conditions:
   - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity:
     - Fire left or right engine to correct large angles or high angular velocity.
   - Angle Near 0:
     - Maintain current state if the lander is near level horizontal and far from the ground.

3. Evaluate Horizontal Position (X Coord) and Velocity (V_x):
   - Outside Wider Center:
     - Use the left or right engine to correct horizontal deviations.
   - Low V_x:
     - Maintain current state unless other conditions suggest corrective action.

4. Leg Contacts:
   - Not in Contact:
     - When neither leg is in contact, monitor vertical velocity and altitude closely.
     - Fire main engine if necessary to adjust orientation and trajectory.

We're analyzing a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

## State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

Answer:
<start>

We're analyzing a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

## State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

## Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Model Strategy:
DO nothing IF ((((Large Angle (right) OR Y Coord Near Ground) AND (NOT V_y High)) OR V_y Upward) OR Angular Velocity High (left))
DO fire left orientation engine IF (((NOT Large Angle (right)) AND (V_y Low OR V_y Upward)) OR Large Angle (left))
DO fire main engine IF ((((NOT Left Leg reach ground) AND (V_x High OR V_y Low)) AND (NOT V_y Upward)) OR V_y High)
DO fire right orientation engine IF (((Angle Near 0 OR Large Angle (right)) OR X Coord Outside Wider Center) OR Right Leg reach ground)

We're analyzing a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

## State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)

Answer:
<start>

We're analyzing a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. 
Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

## State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

## Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle(right)": theta > 0.3 
- "Large Angle(left)": theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= angle_velocity <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High(right)": angle_velocity > 0.2 
- "Angular Velocity High(left)": angle velocity < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1

## Model Strategy:
DO nothing IF ((((Large Angle (right) OR Y Coord Near Ground) AND (NOT V_y High)) OR V_y Upward) OR Angular Velocity High (left))
DO fire left orientation engine IF (((NOT Large Angle (right)) AND (V_y Low OR V_y Upward)) OR Large Angle (left))
DO fire main engine IF ((((NOT Left Leg reach ground) AND (V_x High OR V_y Low)) AND (NOT V_y Upward)) OR V_y High)
DO fire right orientation engine IF (((Angle Near 0 OR Large Angle (right)) OR X Coord Outside Wider Center) OR Right Leg reach ground)
