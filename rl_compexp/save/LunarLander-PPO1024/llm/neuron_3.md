 Key Trigger Conditions:

1. **Vy Upward or Y Coord Near Ground** (Weight: 10.0)
- When the vertical velocity (\( V_y \)) is upward (positive) or the lander is close to the ground, firing the right orientation engine is heavily favored. This suggests stabilizing the lander when descending slowly or hovering near the ground.

2. **Combination of Vy Low/Upward, Y Coord Near Ground, Large Angle, or Angular Velocity High** (Weight: 9.5)
- Firing the right orientation engine also occurs when the vertical velocity is low or upward or the lander is near the ground, exhibiting a large angle, or experiencing high angular velocity. This indicates correcting angular or oscillatory instability.

3. **Angle Near 0 & Y Coord Far From Ground without Right Leg Contact or X Coord Outside Wider Center** (Weight: 8.5)
- This activation highlights the importance of firing the right engine even when the lander is far from the ground, relatively level, and the right leg isn't in contact, suggesting the need for continued angular adjustments or staying aligned when off-center.

4. **Not Right Leg Contact with V_y Low/Upward or X Coord Outside Wider Center** (Weight: 8.4)
- Indicates corrective measures when the right leg is not contacting the ground and the vertical velocity is low or upward, or the lander is significantly off-center. Suggests avoiding lateral drifts away from the landing zone.

5. **Vertical Stabilization** (Weight: 7.2)
- Oriented towards stabilization, indicating the fire action is weighted positively when the vertical velocity is low or upward.

 Practical Decision Guide:

To inform practical decision-making and guide lander operations efficiently, the following checklist can be used:

1. **Check Vertical Velocity and Altitude**:
    - **Condition**: \( V_y \) Upward or Y Coord Near Ground
    - **Action**: Fire right engine for stabilization, especially near the ground or during a slow descent/ascent.

2. **Assess Complex Conditions of Angular Instability**:
    - **Condition**: Any scenario involving low/upward \( V_y \), near ground, high angular velocity, or large angle
    - **Action**: Engage right engine to counteract angular drift or instability.

3. **Evaluate Horizontal Position and Contact Points**:
    - **Condition**: Far from Ground & Angle Near 0 with No Right Leg Contact or Off-Center Position
    - **Action**: Stabilize orientation by firing the right engine even if mid-air and without downward thrust is necessary.

4. **Leg Contact and Velocity Checks**:
    - **Condition**: Low/Upward \( V_y \) and Right Leg Not in Contact or Off-Center
    - **Action**: Correct orientation using the right engine to mitigate any drift or horizontal movability issues.

5. **Vertical Stabilization Priorities**:
    - **Condition**: \( V_y \) Low or Upward
    - **Action**: Fire the right orientation engine to contribute to maintaining vertical stability or downward control.

 Comprehensive Strategy:

1. **Near Ground**:
    - **Condition**: 
      - \( V_y \) Upward or Y Coord Near Ground
      - Large Angle or High Angular Velocity
    - **Action**: Stabilize using the right orientation engine for precise landing control.

2. **Far from Ground**:
    - **Condition**: 
      - Angle Near 0 
      - Y Coord Far from Ground 
      - Right Leg Not in Contact 
      - X Coord Outside Wider Center
    - **Action**: Fire the right engine to manage level orientation and stay centered.

3. **Stabilization Against Instability**:
    - **Condition**: 
      - Not Right Leg Contact 
      - \( V_y \) Low or Upward 
      - Large Angle/High Angular Velocity
    - **Action**: Use the right orientation engine for corrective stabilization and orientation adjustments. Do this especially when encountering rotational or lateral drift away from the intended trajectory.

4. **Moderate Drifts**:
    - **Condition**: 
      - \( V_y \) Low or Upward 
      - Y Coord Near Ground 
    - **Action**: Engage the right engine slightly to ward off drifts and maintain a controlled descent or hover near the ground.

5. **Ensure Vertical Stability**:
    - **Condition**: 
      - \( V_y \) Low or Upward
    - **Action**: Active right engine consistently ensures downward correction toward smooth landing phases.
