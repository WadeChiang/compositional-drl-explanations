We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

## State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

## Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle": theta > 0.3 or theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= omega <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High": omega > 0.2 or omega < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1


## Model Strategy:

Do Nothing if any of the following conditions are met:
The lander has a slight tilt to the right or is close to the ground without dropping too quickly.
The lander is ascending.
The angular velocity is notably leftward.

Fire Left Orientation Engine if:
The lander is not tilting significantly rightward, and it is either descending slowly or ascending.
The lander is tilted significantly leftward.

Fire Main Engine (to slow down descent or stabilize) if:
None of the lander's legs have touched the ground, and it is either moving horizontally at a high speed or descending slowly, and not ascending.
The lander is falling rapidly.

Fire Right Orientation Engine if:
The lander is nearly upright or tilting significantly rightward.
The lander is positioned significantly left or right of the center.
The right leg is in contact with the ground.

Your answer format should be strictly same as the example. Each action you make should strictly follow the strategy, which means if you can't make decision with strategy, you should say -1.

The lander has a slight tilt to the right or is close to the ground without dropping too quickly.
The lander is ascending.
The angular velocity is notably leftward.

Fire Left Orientation Engine if:
The lander is not tilting significantly rightward, and it is either descending slowly or ascending.

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

Answer:
<start>

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

## State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

## Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle": theta > 0.3 or theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= omega <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High": omega > 0.2 or omega < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1


## Model Strategy:

Do Nothing if any of the following conditions are met:
The lander has a slight tilt to the right or is close to the ground without dropping too quickly.
The lander is ascending.
The angular velocity is notably leftward.

Fire Left Orientation Engine if:
The lander is not tilting significantly rightward, and it is either descending slowly or ascending.
The lander is tilted significantly leftward.

Fire Main Engine (to slow down descent or stabilize) if:
None of the lander's legs have touched the ground, and it is either moving horizontally at a high speed or descending slowly, and not ascending.
The lander is falling rapidly.

Fire Right Orientation Engine if:
The lander is nearly upright or tilting significantly rightward.

Your answer format should be strictly same as the example. Each action you make should strictly follow the strategy, which means if you can't make decision with strategy, you should say -1.

We're analyzing the output neurons of a deep reinforcement learning network assigned to the Lunar Lander V2 task. This task uses an 8-dimensional state vector and offers four discrete actions. Your task is to look at the explanation (global strategy) generated by explanation technique of what model does and predict which action should be take based on the given state conditions.

## State and Actions:
State Vector: (x, y coordinates, linear velocities in x & y, angle, angular velocity, boolean states of leg contact).
Observation Space: Box([-1.5 -1.5 -5. -5. -3.1415927 -5. -0. -0. ], [1.5 1.5 5. 5. 3.1415927 5. 1. 1. ], (8,), float32)
Actions: [0: Do nothing, 1: Fire left engine, 2: Fire main engine, 3: Fire right engine].

## Conditions for Activation:
- "X Coord In Center": -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
- "X Coord In Wider Center": -0.4 < x < -0.25 or 0.25 < x < 0.4
- "X Coord Outside Wider Center": lambda inp: x >= +-0.4
- "Y Coord Far From Ground": lambda inp: y > 0.4
- "Y Coord Near Ground": lambda inp: y < 0.4
- "V_x Low": lambda inp: -0.5 <= V_x <= 0.5
- "V_x High": V_x > 0.5 or V_x < -0.5
- "V_y Low": -0.5 <= V_y <= 0.0
- "V_y High": V_y < -0.5
- "V_y Upward": V_y > 0.0
- "Angle Near 0": -0.3 <= theta <= 0.3
- "Large Angle": theta > 0.3 or theta < -0.3
- "Angular Velocity Low": -0.2 <= omega <= 0.2
- "Angular Velocity High": omega > 0.2 or omega < -0.2
- "Left Leg reach ground": l = 1
- "Right Leg reach ground": r = 1


## Model Strategy:

Do Nothing if any of the following conditions are met:
The lander has a slight tilt to the right or is close to the ground without dropping too quickly.
The lander is ascending.
The angular velocity is notably leftward.

Fire Left Orientation Engine if:
The lander is not tilting significantly rightward, and it is either descending slowly or ascending.
The lander is tilted significantly leftward.

Fire Main Engine (to slow down descent or stabilize) if:
None of the lander's legs have touched the ground, and it is either moving horizontally at a high speed or descending slowly, and not ascending.
The lander is falling rapidly.

Fire Right Orientation Engine if:
The lander is nearly upright or tilting significantly rightward.
The lander is positioned significantly left or right of the center.
The right leg is in contact with the ground.
